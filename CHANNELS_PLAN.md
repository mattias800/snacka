## Technical Notes

### Files to Modify

**Controls:**
- `src/Miscord.Client/Controls/ChannelListView.axaml` - Main channel list UI
- `src/Miscord.Client/Controls/ChannelListView.axaml.cs` - Code-behind

**ViewModels:**
- `src/Miscord.Client/ViewModels/MainAppViewModel.cs` - Commands and state
- `src/Miscord.Client/ViewModels/VoiceChannelViewModel.cs` - Voice channel data

**Services:**
- `src/Miscord.Client/Services/ApiModels.cs` - ChannelResponse model
- `src/Miscord.Client/Services/ApiClient.cs` - API calls

**Server:**
- `src/Miscord.Server/Controllers/ChannelsController.cs` - Channel endpoints
- `src/Miscord.Server/Services/ChannelService.cs` - Channel business logic

### Data Model Considerations

The `ChannelResponse` already includes:
- `Position` field for ordering (not yet used in UI)
- `Topic` field for description (not yet displayed)
- `UnreadCount` for badges (implemented)

New fields may be needed for:
- Category/folder grouping
- User limits for voice channels
- Notification settings
- Private channel flags
